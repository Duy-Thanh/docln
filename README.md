Light Novel Reader written in Flutter (for Android, Windows and Linux)

## IMPORTANT NOTICE:

**Due to the lack of hardware needed to build, test, and develop the software, the iOS and macOS versions of the app will NEVER BE RELEASED AND SUPPORTED. This may change in the future, but not now.**

**The Android build is the only build supported. Windows and Linux support is currently in development. Stay tuned!**

**Please note this. Anyone opening an issue related to the iOS and macOS builds will not receive a response, and all iOS and macOS issues will be closed immediately. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding!**

**NOTE 2: The Android bundle build is currently not working. I am working on fixing it. Currently, only the APK build is working. The AAB build is disabled.**
